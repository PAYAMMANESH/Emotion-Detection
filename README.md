# Project: Face Detection and Emotion Recognition Project
# Overview of efforts
This project focuses on detecting faces and recognizing emotions in real-time using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques.
# Software and Libraries



This project requires the following software and Python libraries:

### Software
- **Python**: A programming language used for this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

### Python Libraries
- **OpenCV**: OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision.
- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- **Keras (version 2.14.0)**: High-level neural networks API.
- **TensorFlow (version 2.14.0)**: End-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.
- **face_recognition**: Simple and easy-to-use library for face recognition.
### Haar Cascade Files
This project uses the following model files for emotion recognition:
- **facial_expression_model_structure.json**: JSON file containing the model architecture
- **hfacial_expression_model_weights.h5**: Pre-trained weights for the emotion recognition model.
# Starting the Project
- **Run Jupyter Notebook**
- **Open and Run the Notebook**: In Jupyter Notebook, open the file emotion detection.ipynb and run the code cells sequentially.
